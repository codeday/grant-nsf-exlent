\section{Building Community via a Cohort Model for Participants}

Promoting a sense of belonging is an important feature of this project's strategy to retain students and ultimately guide them into the AI/ML workforce. When students feel a sense of belonging, they are more likely to engage actively and persist in the face of challenges. This project is built as a virtual-first program where student onboarding, training, mentoring, meetings, reflections, and community mostly take place online. Because all students come from the same set of partner colleges, many will already be familiar with each other from classes. We extend and merge those existing communities with the following additional program elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A closed LinkedIn discussion group where students, mentors, staff, alumni, and faculty will share learnings, ask questions, and post job opportunities.
    
    \item Monthly online workshops and panels where students from across the program will engage with industry experts on a particular topic where interactions and Zoom chats are encouraged and lively.
    
    \item Employer information sessions and monthly student office hours that will offer students additional opportunities to engage with the larger community outside of their 1:1 monthly meetings with mentors.

    \item Online group chat ``Slack'' where students will collaborate in real-time, and where work on micro-internships will be coordinated.
\end{itemize}
