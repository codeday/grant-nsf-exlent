The project's independent evaluator is Emilia Gan. Emilia is a current Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington who is studying patterns of programmatic skills development and behavior in Computer Science under the guidance of Dr. Benjamin Mako Hill. She expects to graduate with her Ph.D. prior to the start of this project and will work as a consultant. Emilia and Dr. Hill have previously collaborated with CodeDay and one of the PIs on a publication demonstrating the effect of presenting CS work on long-term retention and are currently working on a study related to student experience in micro-internships. A full biographical sketch of Emilia is included in the supplementary materials for this proposal.
