\section{Generation of Knowledge}

Dissemination activities for CTCtoAI involve sharing results of project and project evaluation activities and practical implementation ``lessons learned''. The expected dissemination activities are detailed in Figure \ref{fig:dissemination}. Dissemination is targeted to the following audiences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item State and national CTC programs across all emerging technology sectors, CTC leaders, and CTC researchers with the help of SBCTC and CCBA (see "Partnerships").
    \item The broader statewide workforce development community with the help of the WTB (see "Partnerships") to share results across other emerging technology sectors in our state and across a network of state agencies.
    \item Industry leaders and potential partners at organizations that develop or use AI technologies as well as the broader open source software community.
\end{itemize}

CTCtoAI project staff will submit project-generated data, project reports, and other materials to the Washington State Center of Excellence in Information \& Computing Technology and the AppConnect NW network for possible inclusion in these agencies’ resource libraries, in accordance with the project’s Data Management plan.
