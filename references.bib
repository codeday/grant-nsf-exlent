	url = {https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10195607-engaging-stem-transformational-experiences-early-momentum-esteem},
	abstract = {Need/Motivation (e.g., goals, gaps in knowledge) The ESTEEM implemented a STEM building capacity project through students’ early access to a sustainable and innovative STEM Stepping Stones, called Micro-Internships (MI). The goal is to reap key benefits of a full-length internship and undergraduate research experiences in an abbreviated format, including access, success, degree completion, transfer, and recruiting and retaining more Latinx and underrepresented students into the STEM workforce. The MIs are designed with the goals to provide opportunities for students at a community college and HSI, with authentic STEM research and applied learning experiences (ALE), support for appropriate STEM pathway/career, preparation and confidence to succeed in STEM and engage in summer long REUs, and with improved outcomes. The MI projects are accessible early to more students and build momentum to better overcome critical obstacles to success. The MIs are shorter, flexibly scheduled throughout the year, easily accessible, and participation in multiple MI is encouraged. ESTEEM also establishes a sustainable and collaborative model, working with partners from BSCS Science Education, for MI’s mentor, training, compliance, and building capacity, with shared values and practices to maximize the improvement of student outcomes. New Knowledge (e.g., hypothesis, research questions) Research indicates that REU/internship experiences can be particularly powerful for students from Latinx and underrepresented groups in STEM. However, those experiences are difficult to access for many HSI-community college students (85\% of our students hold off-campus jobs), and lack of confidence is a barrier for a majority of our students. The gap between those who can and those who cannot is the “internship access gap.” This project is at a central California Community College (CCC) and HSI, the only affordable post-secondary option in a region serving a historically underrepresented population in STEM, including 75\% Hispanic, and 87\% have not completed college. MI is designed to reduce inequalities inherent in the internship paradigm by providing access to professional and research skills for those underserved students. The MI has been designed to reduce barriers by offering: shorter duration (25 contact hours); flexible timing (one week to once a week over many weeks); open access/large group; and proximal location (on-campus). MI mentors participate in week-long summer workshops and ongoing monthly community of practice with the goal of co-constructing a shared vision, engaging in conversations about pedagogy and learning, and sustaining the MI program going forward. Approach (e.g., objectives/specific aims, research methodologies, and analysis) Research Question and Methodology: We want to know: How does participation in a micro-internship affect students’ interest and confidence to pursue STEM? We used a mixed-methods design triangulating quantitative Likert-style survey data with interpretive coding of open-responses to reveal themes in students’ motivations, attitudes toward STEM, and confidence. Participants: The study sampled students enrolled either part-time or full-time at the community college. Although each MI was classified within STEM, they were open to any interested student in any major. Demographically, participants self-identified as 70\% Hispanic/Latinx, 13\% Mixed-Race, and 42 female. Instrument: Student surveys were developed from two previously validated instruments that examine the impact of the MI intervention on student interest in STEM careers and pursuing internships/REUs. Also, the pre- and post (every e months to assess longitudinal outcomes) -surveys included relevant open response prompts. The surveys collected students’ demographics; interest, confidence, and motivation in pursuing a career in STEM; perceived obstacles; and past experiences with internships and MIs. 171 students responded to the pre-survey at the time of submission. Outcomes (e.g., preliminary findings, accomplishments to date) Because we just finished year 1, we lack at this time longitudinal data to reveal if student confidence is maintained over time and whether or not students are more likely to (i) enroll in more internships, (ii) transfer to a four-year university, or (iii) shorten the time it takes for degree attainment. For short term outcomes, students significantly Increased their confidence to continue pursuing opportunities to develop within the STEM pipeline, including full-length internships, completing STEM degrees, and applying for jobs in STEM. For example, using a 2-tailed t-test we compared means before and after the MI experience. 15 out of 16 questions that showed improvement in scores were related to student confidence to pursue STEM or perceived enjoyment of a STEM career. Finding from the free-response questions, showed that the majority of students reported enrolling in the MI to gain knowledge and experience. After the MI, 66\% of students reported having gained valuable knowledge and experience, and 35\% of students spoke about gaining confidence and/or momentum to pursue STEM as a career. Broader Impacts (e.g., the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM; development of a diverse STEM workforce, enhanced infrastructure for research and education) The ESTEEM project has the potential for a transformational impact on STEM undergraduate education’s access and success for underrepresented and Latinx community college students, as well as for STEM capacity building at Hartnell College, a CCC and HSI, for students, faculty, professionals, and processes that foster research in STEM and education. Through sharing and transfer abilities of the ESTEEM model to similar institutions, the project has the potential to change the way students are served at an early and critical stage of their higher education experience at CCC, where one in every five community college student in the nation attends a CCC, over 67\% of CCC students identify themselves with ethnic backgrounds that are not White, and 40 to 50\% of University of California and California State University graduates in STEM started at a CCC, thus making it a key leverage point for recruiting and retaining a more diverse STEM workforce.},

Employment in this sector is projected to grow 12\% between 2018 and 2028, which is faster than the average of all other occupations. Published data are available on traditional non-computer science-specific hiring processes. However, the hiring process for CS majors may be different. It is critical to have up-to-date information on questions such as “what positions are in high demand for CS majors?,” “what is a typical hiring process?,” and “what do employers say they look for when hiring CS graduates?” This article discusses the analysis of a survey of 218 recruiters hiring CS graduates in the United States. We used Atlas.ti to analyze qualitative survey data and report the results on what positions are in the highest demand, the hiring process, and the resume review process. Our study revealed that a software developer was the most common job the recruiters were looking to fill. We found that the hiring process steps for CS graduates are generally aligned with traditional hiring steps, with an additional emphasis on technical and coding tests. Recruiters reported that their hiring choices were based on reviewing resume’s experience, GPA, and projects sections. The results provide insights into the hiring process, decision making, resume analysis, and some discrepancies between current undergraduate CS program outcomes and employers’ expectations.},

This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review conducted to determine which areas graduating students most frequently fall short of the expectations of industry or macademia. The results of this review indicate that graduating students are lacking in many different areas, including technical abilities (design, testing, configuration management tools, etc.) personal skills (communication, teamwork, etc.) and professional qualities (e.g. ethics). By raising awareness of these areas, it is possible for educators to become aware of areas where students most frequently fail to meet expectations and to make curriculum changes or adjustments to address these problems},

Since then, its existence has been regularly reported on and solutions to close it have been proposed. However, after thirty years this gap resists all efforts for closure. In this study we assert that the gap between industry and academia exists for several reasons that are related and intertwined. To take a broader look at the problem from the perspective of all related entities, we (i) provide a detailed overview of the profession and identify the entities, (ii) extract the causes that stem from these entities and discuss what each entity should do, (iii) report and analyze the results of a questionnaire that has been conducted with students and recent graduates, (iv) emphasize the highlights of the interviews conducted with students, recent graduates and academics, (v) and compile a list of skills that are sought by the industry by analyzing the software engineering job advertisements. We further contribute to finding solutions by considering all entities involved, which provides an opportunity to access all of them, so that each can find out what they can do to acknowledge and narrow the gap. Our study concludes that the gap requires constant attention and hard work for all of the entities involved, and therefore all should be on the lookout for new technologies, learn to embrace the changes and adapt to them, so that the gap is kept at a minimum.},

The purpose of this article is to describe an information-processing perspective on the contribution of study skills to academic competence, and to identify evidence-based strategies that are effective in helping students to improve their study skills. Using an information-processing framework, study skills are grouped into four clusters: repetition-based skills, procedural study skills, cognitive-based study skills, and metacognitive skills. Key elements of effective study-strategy training are delineated.},

Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects are FOSS projects that broadly but intentionally aim to improve the human condition. This paper analyzes data from five years of a two-semester capstone experience in which students consider a number of FOSS and/or HFOSS projects and choose one to engage with. Findings support assertions that projects with humanitarian goals are preferred by both women and students with lower confidence in their software development and teamwork skills. The data analysis is suggestive that African American, Black and Hispanic (ABH) students may also show preferences for projects with humanitarian goals. An exploratory analysis of pre-course survey data adds additional insight into how gender, race/ethnicity, student confidence and perceptions of community may influence project selection, helping to identify important directions for further investigation. Collectively the results presented here reinforce suggestions that incorporating HFOSS, or more generally computing with social value, holds potential for broadening participation in computing.},

This research found that oftentimes what is beneficial for female majors also aids males' performance. For male and female majors alike, intrinsic motivation, being emotionally healthy, and experiencing little stress predicted high CS grades. Both males and females thrived academically when they had excellent instructors using good pedagogical practices. However, several predictors of CS grades were gender-specific. Female majors with positive stereotypes about CS students, who had had female computer teachers in middle school, felt interconnected with others, felt that peers are not cliquish, and perceived that faculty treat female students equitably had higher CS grades than female majors who scored lower on these variables. Overall, female majors' grades could be predicted more accurately than males' grades. Interestingly, previous computer experience was not related to CS grades. This knowledge can be harnessed to provide an optimal environment for all students, especially females, to enhance their CS course performance, and ultimately to increase retention in the major.},

During its short lifetime, the Project has inspired increasing numbers of students and instructors to make significant contributions to several humanitarian open source software development projects.

In the last four years, the HFOSS Project has received material support from several partners, including the National Science Foundation, Accenture, Google, and Mozilla. This support has enabled the Project to expand its reach to add new college and university partners and to add more humanitarian software projects.  

Contributions to the HFOSS Project come from professionals in academia, IT organizations, and non-profit organizations that engage undergraduate students in courses, research projects, and summer internship experiences. Its curriculum is accessible to a wide range of undergraduates, since it includes courses for non- majors as well as computer science and engineering majors.

This paper describes all these activities and their impact on undergraduate computing education, local non-profit organizations, and global FOSS communities. It concludes by identifying the progress that the HFOSS Project has made toward developing a sustainable infrastructure.},

While some schools are content to use VBBLs to spark interest and motivation for the future pursuit of computing, others are asking, "Does this early exposure produce knowledge that transfers to traditional text-based languages (TBLs)?" If transfer is a goal, then a corollary is, "How do we design the transition to maximize the transfer?" This paper focuses on initialization of state and variables, exploring the differences between Scratch and two TBLs: C and Java. Based on observations of 9-12 year old students in a VBBL curriculum, we identify four "pieces of knowledge" that are critical for C and Java but are not nearly as obvious in Scratch, including whether, when, and how to perform initialization. We conclude with suggestions for instruction and development environment that may improve transfer.},

Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.},

In an effort to understand how tools like Scratch and Blockly differ from more conventional text-based introductory programming languages with respect to conceptual understanding, we developed a set of "commutative" assessments. Each multiple-choice question on the assessment includes a short program that can be displayed in either a blocks- based or text-based form. The set of potential answers for each question includes the correct answer along with choices informed by prior research on novice programming misconceptions. In this paper we introduce the Commutative Assessment, discuss the theoretical and practical motivations for the assessment, and present findings from a study that used the assessment. The study had 90 high school students take the assessment at three points over the course of the first ten weeks of an introduction to programming course, alternating the modality (blocks vs. text) for each question over the course of the three administrations of the assessment. Our analysis reveals differences on performance between blocks-based and text-based questions as well as differences in the frequency of misconceptions based on the modality. Future work, potential implications, and limitations of these findings are also discussed.},

The majority (63\%) of the alumni survey respondents, who are in college, are majoring in computing. A similar percentage of the alumni who are still in high school intend to major in computing (62\%). When asked about the programs' impact on their career choices and interest in computing, 61\% of respondents indicated that the program increased their interest in computer science and 24\% indicated that it changed their career plans to computing.},

Applying a systematic approach to collecting papers presented at the Symposium that focus on novice programming / CS1, we categorized hundreds of papers according to their main focus, revealing important introductory programming topics and their trends from 1970 to 2018. Some of these topics have faded from prominence and are less relevant today while others, including many topics focused on students, such as making learning programming more appropriate from gender, diversity, accessibility and inclusion standpoints, have garnered significant attention more recently. We present discussions on these trends and in doing so, we provide a checkpoint for introductory programming research.

By constraining syntax and providing concrete visual representations on which to operate, direct manipulation programming environments can potentially lower these barriers. However, what if the ultimate learning goal of the novice is to be able to program in conventional textual languages, as is the case for introductory computer science students? Can direct manipulation programming environments lower the initial barriers to programming, and, at the same time, facilitate positive transfer to textual programming? To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes. Our results show that direct manipulation interfaces can provide novices with a “way in” to traditional textual programming.},

To combat this trend, our department has made a concerted effort to revamp our introductory course sequence to both attract and retain more women and minority students. The focus of this paper is the changes instituted in our Introduction to Computer Science course (i.e., CS1) intended for both majors and non-majors. In addition to changing the content of the course, we introduced a new student mentoring program that is managed by a full-time coordinator and consists of undergraduate students who have recently completed the course. This paper describes these efforts in detail, including the extension of these changes to our CS2 course and the associated costs required to maintain these efforts. We measure the impact of these changes by tracking student enrollment and performance over 13 academic years. We show that, unlike national trends, enrollment from underrepresented groups has increased dramatically over this time period. Additionally, we show that the student mentoring program has increased both performance and retention of students, particularly from underrepresented groups, at statistically significant levels.},

At the same time, most CS departments across the country are only seeing 25-30\% of female students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at Rutgers University using three data sets that span thousands of students across 3.5 academic years. By combining these data sets, we can explore interesting issues such as retention, as students progress through the CS major. For example, we find that a large percentage of women taking the Introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which contributes to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that a large part of the retention task is attracting these women to further explore the major. We correlate our findings with initiatives that some CS programs across the country have taken to significantly improve their gender diversity, and identify initiatives that we can start with in our effort to increase the diversity in our program. These findings may also be applicable to the computing programs at other large public research universities.},

The study found that the mixture of teaching mindset and giving mindset messages on returned work resulted in a significant change in mindset and a corresponding significant change in test scores – improvements in test scores were found in a class test given immediately after the six-week intervention and at the end-of-year exam.

This is counter to research indicating that code comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers. We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and furthermore, that students weren’t making the connection between code comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200 pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.},

However, little is known about the effects of enrollment policies on students' experiences. To identify relationships between those policies and students' experiences, we linked survey data from 1245 first-year students in 80 CS departments to a dataset of department policies. We found that competitive enrollment negatively predicts first-year students' perception of the computing department as welcoming, their sense of belonging, and their self-efficacy in computing. Both belonging and self-efficacy are known predictors of student retention in CS. In addition, these relationships are stronger for students without pre-college computing experience. Our classification of institutions as competitive is conservative, and false positives are likely. This biases our results and suggests that the negative relationships we found are an underestimation of the effects of competitive enrollment.},

We conducted an in-class study that controlled for both time-on-task and selection bias to investigate the potential benefits of integrating these interventions into the existing footprint of an introductory computing course. Despite the previously reported promise of the interventions we implemented, our findings were that in this context these techniques had only a mild positive effect for some students. We discuss possible reasons why these techniques are less successful than instructors might hope and argue for the need for more research on this topic.},

The objective is to determine if faculty development in growth mindset and active use of the growth mindset cues in the CS0 and CS1 classroom result in superior academic outcomes. Comparative study results are presented for two semesters of virtual classroom environments: one semester without Growth Mindset, and one semester with Growth Mindset. Female students demonstrated the most growth, as measured by academic grades, in CS0, and maintained that growth in CS1. Males demonstrated growth as well, with both males and females converging at the same high point of accomplishment at the end of CS1.

Although there have been a number of studies on student attitudes toward learning within HFOSS projects, little has been documented about instructors' experiences supporting their students in the classroom. This paper examines survey results from 26 faculty members who participated in an NSF-funded Professors' Open Source Software Experience workshop with the goal of incorporating HFOSS into their curriculum. The survey was designed to identify barriers to using HFOSS in the classroom, to understand the type of classes where instructors incorporated HFOSS, the successes attained and challenges faced by instructors, and to understand instructors' future plans. The data gathered was used to enhance semi-structured interviews that are currently being analyzed. This paper focuses on the hurdles reported by faculty members, the cross-section of uses of HFOSS in the classroom as well as factors that may influence one's ability to integrate HFOSS into the curriculum. The results of the survey demonstrate that faculty have successfully incorporated HFOSS into a wide range of courses across all four years of the curriculum with both large and small classes. The major hurdles are time to prepare materials for one's course as well as finding time within an existing course to integrate HFOSS material.},

Based on the analysis, we propose a framework for understanding these strategies and suggest how task resumption might be better supported in future development tools. The results suggest that task resumption is a frequent and persistent problem for developers. For example, we find that only 10\% of the sessions have programming activity resume in less than 1 min after an interruption, only 7\% of the programming sessions involve no navigation to other locations prior to editing. We also found that programmers use multiple coping mechanisms to recover task context when resuming work.},

Both work and nonwork stress are independently associated with physical and mental health, although the relationship between nonwork stress and health is slightly stronger. Excessive demands or stresses in one domain can interfere with life in the other. Such conflict operates equally in both directions. When present it can be an added source of stress and adversely affect health. Taken together these findings suggest that the stress people experience at work is not simply a reflection of their "personal problems."

However, several critics have raised concerns that whiteboard interviews can cause excessive stress and cognitive load on candidates, ultimately reinforcing bias in hiring practices. Unfortunately, many sensors used for measuring cognitive state are not robust to movement. In this paper, we describe an approach where we use a head-mounted eye-tracker and computer vision algorithms to collect robust metrics of cognitive state. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we study two proposed interview settings: on the whiteboard and on paper with 11 participants. Our preliminary results suggest that the whiteboard setting pressures candidates into keeping shorter attention lengths and experiencing higher levels of cognitive load compared to solving the same problems on paper. For instance, we observed 60ms shorter fixation durations and 3x more regressions when solving problems on the whiteboard. Finally, we describe a vision for creating a more inclusive technical interview process through future studies of interventions that lower cognitive load and stress.},

	abstract = {Producing sufficient numbers of graduates who are prepared for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations has become a national priority in the United States. To attain this goal, some policymakers have targeted reducing STEM attrition in college, arguing that retaining more students in STEM fields in college is a low-cost, fast way to produce   the STEM professionals that the nation needs (President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST] 2012). Within this context, this Statistical Analysis Report (SAR) presents an examination ofstudents’ attrition from STEM fields over the course of 6 years in college using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09) and the associated 2009 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS:09). In this SAR, the term STEM attrition refers to enrollment choices that result in potential STEM graduates (i.e., undergraduates who declare a STEM major) moving away from STEM fields by switching majors to non-STEM fields or leaving postsecondary education before earning a degree or certificate.1 The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of this attrition by: •determining rates of attrition from STEM and non-STEM fields; •identifying characteristics of students who leave STEM fields;•comparing the STEM coursetaking and performance of STEM leavers and persisters; and•examining the strength of various factors’ associations with STEM attrition.Data from a cohort of students who started their postsecondary education in a bachelor’s or associate’s degree program in the 2003−04 academic year were used to examine students’ movement into and out of STEM fields over the subsequent6 years through 2009. Analyses were performed separately for beginning bachelor’s and associate’s degree students. For brevity, these two groups are frequently referred to as bachelor’s or associate’s degree students in this study. Selected findings from this SAR are described below.},

However, little is empirically known about the impact industry-based internships have on CS students' career paths as well as the effectiveness of CS degree programs in preparing students for these professional development opportunities. In this paper, we present a thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses of 40 CS undergraduate students in the US who participated in an internship. This study aimed to understand the impact that professional internships have on: CS students' career goals, students' perceptions of the gaps between academia and industry, and students' strategies for professional success. We found four themes that describe the impact of internships on CS students. Internships (1) strengthened students' commitment to CS degrees and careers; (2) encouraged exploration of CS careers and industries; (3) promoted personal/professional growth; and (4) developed awareness of professional expectations. We also analyzed students' perception of the curriculum's effectiveness and found that students were strategically working to improve their technical skills outside of coursework to secure employment. These findings have the potential to retain students in computing and reduce the gaps between academia and industry, thereby increasing CS students' competitiveness in the workforce.},

This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment.

Understanding these views could shed light on why the academia-industry gap has persisted despite the attention. This study identified faculty views on the goals of an undergraduate education and a CS major, focusing on preparation for careers in industry. In order to identify a spectrum of faculty views, we interviewed 14 faculty from a variety of backgrounds across three institutions. A phenomenographic analysis of the transcripts reveals that many faculty believe that industry preparation is an important programmatic goal, yet they encounter significant resource obstacles to achieving that goal.},

SCCT focuses on students' prior experience, social support, self-efficacy and outcome expectation. The research is partly motivated by the desire to increase female participation rates in CS, particularly in the UK. Policymakers can use the factors that both females and males identify as influencing their choice of studying CS to enhance the experiences of all students prior to coming to university, but female students in particular. The study uses a semi-structured interview with 17 mixed gender subjects currently studying CS at three Scottish universities. The findings are that social support from family, teachers, friends and mentors is a particularly important factor in choosing to study CS, especially for female subjects. The career paths offered by a CS degree is another major factor, not just the potential jobs, but also the general value of a CS education and the potential to make useful contributions to society. School education appeared to have limited influence, though exposure to problem solving, programming, online self-learning and internships are positive influences. The stereotypical view of CS students as 'geeks' is outdated and unhelpful - it is more appropriate to see them as 'analytical' or 'over-achievers'. Subjects make many suggestions for improving the CS education provided at school, especially to make it more attractive to females, including: make it compulsory, teach it earlier, include more programming and problem solving, and increase the visibility of female exemplars and role models.},

However, it is important that any employment‐related developments and initiatives are informed by the opinions and experiences of present and former students. This paper addresses this need by comparing the undergraduate career expectations and post‐graduation career experiences of geography students from the University of Plymouth. The study allows comparisons to be made between two cohorts and reveals which aspects of their degree the graduate cohort found to be most and least useful in their current employment.},

While advanced courses and electives are taken on campus as usual, some core computer science classes and practicum courses are delivered with the industry partner so as to integrate them with placements on site. Assessment remains the responsibility of the university. In this report, we describe the partnership from the perspective of the industry partner.

New graduates must not only master the technical skills of design and programming, but also be proficient in other skills such as teamwork and inter-personal communication as well as understand ethical and social values that are important to computing. Two capstone computer science courses at our university offer excellent opportunities for students to integrate service learning with the concepts learned in the classroom to outside projects. For the past three years, students in these courses participated in small service learning project teams and interacted with “real” clients while supervised by a faculty member of the computer science program. This sort of experiential learning helped instill a sense of social, professional and ethical responsibilities now considered so vital in the computing field.},

	abstract = {Opportunities for industry involvement in capstone design courses go beyond industry sponsorship of capstone design projects. Representatives from industry can serve as guest lecturers, curriculum advisors, and design project sponsors and team mentors. Since 2000, industry participation has been a core part of the capstone design course at Marquette University. Practicing engineers provide a relevant, practical real-world perspective of their topic, reinforcing its importance to professional engineering practice. Students and faculty benefit from the up-to-date treatment of the topic provided by guest speakers from industry who have expertise in the topic and are willing to share their experiences with students. Students benefit from industry sponsorship of senior design projects through the opportunity to work on realworld problems of importance to industry, exposure to industry and company-specific project management and product development processes, and familiarity with economic, legal, and regulatory design constraints. This paper provides a brief description of the Multidisciplinary Capstone Design course at Marquette University, examples of industry involvement in the course, and the observed benefits of industry involvement to students, the university, and industry participants. It presents examples of current practices used at other schools as well as helpful recommendations for managing industry participation in capstone design courses.},

However, little is empirically known about CS students’ participation in industry internships and the preparation process used to successfully securing an internship. This paper presents findings from our multi-institutional study aimed at understanding the participation of CS students in industry internships as well as analyzing the differences between students who intern and those who do not. We surveyed 536 CS undergraduate students across three universities in the United States and analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. We used thematic analysis on the open-ended survey responses. Overall, we found that 40\% of students participate in at least one internship. Demographically, equal proportions of males and females interned. However, we observed that students who have higher socioeconomic status were more likely to intern. Academically, there were no significant differences between students who intern and those who do not. However, through thematic analysis, we found differences regarding students’ preparation process. Interns explicitly prepared to secure internship positions by practicing interview questions and dedicating time to career preparation. Students who do not intern were less involved in the application process or relied on coursework for securing internships. Quantitative results from the survey corroborated our qualitative findings that factors outside of coursework are influencing students’ ability to secure industry internships.},

The authors develop the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The importance of internships has grown during the last decade. Internships have a lot of benefits for both, the company and the intern as well. In order to get most out of an internship, it is important that knowledge, which is related to the job assignments, is efficiently transferred to the interns. The purpose of this study is to explore the processes of knowledge transfer to the interns based on Nonoka and Takeuchi's knowledge creation model with a focus on tacit to explicit knowledge transfer.

The transfer of the required knowledge is twofold: firstly, interns must have access to already existing documents (rather explicit knowledge). Secondly, interns acquire knowledge through permanent transfer of knowledge from those who are highly experienced, like principals or workmates (rather tacit knowledge). This study used a qualitative approach to collect and analyze empirical data whereas two sources were used. In a first phase of the empirical survey a diary study with nine participants was carried out. In a following second phase semi-structured interviews with another 20 participants were conducted. The study represents the perspective of business informatics students who have to complete an internship as part of their studies.

Participants state that the best experience of their internship is based on a combination of personal support, self-reliant working and the opportunity to have access to content or knowledge management systems. An intensive training phase conducted by co-workers or previous interns is perceived positively in gaining relevant knowledge for their internship. From a qualitative perspective the support of people was ranked on the first place. The technological aspects such as knowledge management tools actively support the process of knowledge sharing.},

The report highlights challenges and barriers to retention and persistence that include a lack of knowledge of evidence-based teaching by faculty, and a lack of facilitation and reward for good teaching.

PCAST identified five overarching recommendations: (1) catalyze widespread adoption of empirically validated teaching practices; (2) advocate and provide support for replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery ­based research courses; (3) launch a national experiment in postsecondary mathematics education to address the mathematics­ preparation gap; (4) encourage partnerships among stakeholders to diversify pathways to STEM careers; and (5) create a Presidential Council on STEM Education with leadership from the academic and business communities to provide strategic leadership for transformative and sustainable change in STEM undergraduate education.},

We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of I972 which includes postsecondary transcript data and the NLS Y to study the distinct returns to 2-year and 4-year college attendance and degree completion. Controlling for family income and measured ability, wage differentials for both 2-year and 4-year college credits are positive and similar. We find that the average 2-year and 4-year college student earned roughly 5\% more than similar high school graduates for every year of credits completed. Second, average bachelor and associate degree recipients did not earn significantly more than those with similar numbers of college credits and no degree, suggesting that the credentialling effects of these degree are small. We report similar results from the NLSY and the CPS. In addition to controlling for family background and ability measures, we pursue two IV strategies to identify measurement error and selection bias. First, we use self-reported education as an instrument for transcript reported education. Second, we use public tuition and distance from the closest 2-year and 4-year colleges as instruments, which we take as orthogonal to schooling measurement error and other unobserved characteristics of college students. Although research over the past decade has been preoccupied with selection bias, the two biases roughly cancel each other, suggesting that the results above are, if anything, understated.},

	abstract = {Studies show that high-tenure displaced workers typically incur substantial long-term earnings losses. As these losses have become increasingly apparent, policy makers have significantly expanded resources for retraining, much of which takes place in regular community college classes. To analyze the effectiveness of such training, we link administrative earnings records with the community college transcript records of workers displaced from jobs during the first half of the 1990s in Washington State. We explore several issues of statistical specification for regression models quantifying the impact of community college credits on earnings. These include (i) the need to allow for a transition period immediately after the end of workers’ schooling when their earnings may be temporarily depressed, (ii) whether earnings gains are strictly proportional to credits earned, and (iii) how to model worker-specific unobserved heterogeneity. In our preferred specification, we find that the equivalent of an academic year of community college schooling raises the long-term earnings of displaced workers by an average of about 9 percent for men and about 13 percent for women. However, these average returns mask substantial variation in the returns associated with different types of courses. On the one hand, we estimate that an academic year of more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses raise earnings by about 14 percent for men and 29 percent for women. On the other hand, we estimate that less technically oriented courses yield very low and possibly zero returns. About one third of the increase in earnings associated with more technically oriented vocational and academic math and science courses is estimated to be due to increases in wage rates, with the remainder attributable to increased hours of work.},

	abstract = {Enrollment at America’s community colleges has exploded in recent years, with five times as many entering students today as in 1965. However, most community college students do not graduate; many earn no credits and may leave school with no more advantages in the labor market than if they had never attended. Experts disagree over the reason for community colleges’ mixed record. Is it that the students in these schools are under-prepared and ill-equipped for the academic rigors of college? Are the colleges themselves not adapting to keep up with the needs of the new kinds of students they are enrolling? In After Admission, James Rosenbaum, Regina Deil-Amen, and Ann Person weigh in on this debate with a close look at this important trend in American higher education. After Admission compares community colleges with private occupational colleges that offer accredited associates degrees. The authors examine how these different types of institutions reach out to students, teach them social and cultural skills valued in the labor market, and encourage them to complete a degree. Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, and Person find that community colleges are suffering from a kind of identity crisis as they face the inherent complexities of guiding their students towards four-year colleges or to providing them with vocational skills to support a move directly into the labor market. This confusion creates administrative difficulties and problems allocating resources. However, these contradictions do not have to pose problems for students. After Admission shows that when colleges present students with clear pathways, students can effectively navigate the system in a way that fits their needs. The occupational colleges the authors studied employed close monitoring of student progress, regular meetings with advisors and peer cohorts, and structured plans for helping students meet career goals in a timely fashion. These procedures helped keep students on track and, the authors suggest, could have the same effect if implemented at community colleges. As college access grows in America, institutions must adapt to meet the needs of a new generation of students. After Admission highlights organizational innovations that can help guide students more effectively through higher education.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the mission of the market-responsive community college. These colleges include mid- and high-level workforce training in their curriculum. Some of the characteristics of a market-responsive community college detailed here include: (1) allocating resources to develop training programs; (2) reaching out to businesses and other organizations; (3) responding rapidly to changes in local economic conditions and training needs; (4) recruiting faculty from among local experts in the field; and (5) partnering with other local educational institutions to deliver comprehensive training. Over 200 publications were reviewed for this report, and the 25 articles that contained the most relevant information, including descriptions of labor-market responsive behavior, were selected. The four methodologies used in preparing the articles that were selected were: (1) statistical analysis; (2) less formal data analysis; (3) literature reviews; and (4) anecdotal evidence. The conclusions of this review will be used as hypotheses to be thoroughly tested in the next phase of this initiative. A reading of the literature found that outsourced training expenditures for U.S. companies nearly doubled, from \$9.9 billion to \$19.3 billion annually, between 1994 and 2000.

	abstract = {While promoting postsecondary credential completion is a national priority intended to help graduates secure good jobs, the value of credentials in the labor market from the perspective of employers is not well understood. Specifically, more attention is needed to understand how credentials align with employer needs. Through in-depth interviews with managers responsible for hiring information technology technicians, we examined their perceptions of associate and bachelor’s degree holders in two contrasting labor markets: Detroit and Seattle. The study led to several key findings. First, across the two labor markets, employers expected some common qualities in both associate and bachelor’s degree holders, including technical skills and knowledge, thinking skills, communication skills, and discipline. Second, while they expected some positive qualities in associate degree holders that were distinctive to this credential, many hiring managers also expected negative characteristics, such as a lack of academic ability, initiative, or skill. However, while both associate and bachelor’s degrees provided relevant information about potential workers, employers did not expect the credentials to provide information about certain key qualities they sought in workers, including competency in customer service and teamwork, and personal interest in technology. Some of the qualities that employers expected in associate degree holders were linked to their local labor markets and their perceptions of the local community colleges. This study provides suggestions on how an understanding of the specific qualities employers expect in credential holders and of the role of the local labor market can help colleges better engage with employers and fine-tune their programs to more effectively meet students’ and employer’s needs.},

However, too few American students, especially women, pursue these fields. Although this problem has attracted enormous attention, rigorously tested interventions outside artificial laboratory settings are quite rare. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment investigating the effect of peer mentoring on women’s experiences and retention in engineering during college transition, assessing its impact for 1 y while mentoring was active, and an additional 1 y after mentoring had ended. Incoming women engineering students (
              n
              = 150) were randomly assigned to female or male peer mentors or no mentors for 1 y. Their experiences were assessed multiple times during the intervention year and 1-y postintervention. Female (but not male) mentors protected women’s belonging in engineering, self-efficacy, motivation, retention in engineering majors, and postcollege engineering aspirations. Counter to common assumptions, better engineering grades were not associated with more retention or career aspirations in engineering in the first year of college. Notably, increased belonging and self-efficacy were significantly associated with more retention and career aspirations. The benefits of peer mentoring endured long after the intervention had ended, inoculating women for the first 2 y of college—the window of greatest attrition from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. Thus, same-gender peer mentoring for a short period during developmental transition points promotes women’s success and retention in engineering, yielding dividends over time.},

	abstract = {Several open source software (OSS) communities promote and participate in initiatives such as summers of code to foster contributions and attract new developers. However, little is known about how successful these initiatives are. As a case study, we analyzed Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which is a three-month program that fosters students' participation in OSS projects. We found that 82\% of the studied OSS projects merged at least one students' commit in codebase. When only newcomers are considered, {\textasciitilde}54\% of OSS projects merged at least one commit. We also found that {\textasciitilde}23\% of newcomers started contributing to GSoC projects before knowing they would be accepted. We also did not find statistical difference between newcomers and students with prior participation in the projects regarding retention time after GSoC, except for 2015 edition. Using survival analysis, we found that {\textasciitilde}40\% of students kept contributing longer than a month, while {\textasciitilde}15\% contributed longer than a year. OSS communities can take advantage of our results to balance the trade-offs involved in joining this kind of program and to set expectations about how much contribution to expect and for how long students engage.},

	abstract = {A student internship in a suitable business or organization can augment, reinforce, and embellish material learned in the classroom. Computer Science student interns can experience such things as real-world development environments, projects which greatly exceed the scale of typical programming assignments, the utter importance of (possibly lacking) documentation, as well as diverse languages, operating systems, and hardware. Opportunities for such internships occur rarely, however, for many rural two-year colleges, especially those geographically isolated from companies which could provide this experience. Despite such a situation at our college, we still provide students with an internship experience by creating an internal organization: the Software Development Internship (SDI) with the mission to develop custom software for other departments on campus. In this paper we describe the formation of the SDI, its activities, and some of the benefits and lessons learned to date.},

	abstract = {Community colleges have become an important entryway for students intending to complete a baccalaureate degree. However, many question the viability of the transfer function and wonder whether students suffer a penalty for starting at a two-year institution. This paper examines how the outcomes of community college entrants compare to similar students who initially entered four-year institutions within the Ohio public higher education system. Using a detailed dataset, we track outcomes for nine years and employ multiple strategies to deal with selection issues: propensity score matching and instrumental variables. The results suggest that straightforward estimates are significantly biased, but even after accounting for selection, students who initially begin at a community college were 14.5 percent less likely to complete a bachelor's degree within nine years.},
